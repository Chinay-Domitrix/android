/**
 * Splits a string to a grid mimicking the behavior of pasting to a spreadsheet.
 *
 * Newline and tab characters are treated as row and cell delimiters respectively unless they are
 * located inside segments enclosed in double quotes (`'"'`). Two consecutive double quotes inside
 * a quoted segment are interpreted as one double quote.
 *
 * The result is always a rectangular grid, which in some cases requires adding empty cells. If any
 * empty cells had to be added to produce a rectangular grid, the method considered alternative
 * interpretations of the input string, where some newline and tab characters are treated as row
 * and cell delimiters despite being located inside quoted segments. An interpretation that
 * minimizes the number of added empty cells is preferred.
 *
 * See `GridParseUtilsTest` for examples of input strings and the produced grids.
